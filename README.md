# AWS Microservices Portfolio: Cloud-Native Service Architecture

This repository contains a collection of microservices built using **AWS cloud services**, each designed to demonstrate a specific capability or integration. The goal is to provide hands-on, production-style implementations for building a modern backend cloud-native stack.

## ðŸ§­ Project Overview

Each microservice in this repo focuses on one or more AWS services and follows best practices for clean architecture, security, observability, and modularity.

| TODO | Cloud storage microservice | S3 |
| TODO | Secrets and configuration | SSM Parameter Store, Secrets Manager |
| TODO | Auth and user isolation | IAM |
